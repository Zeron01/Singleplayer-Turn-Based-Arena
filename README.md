# Singleplayer-Turn-Based-Arena

Original version from the turn based arena game a few years back, now supporting multiplayer, which is here https://github.com/Zeron01/Multiplayer-Turn-based-Arena.

This one is much more simpler and just uses one terminal.

Was made originally for my friends to try it out when I was experimenting ways to make text appear written on a terminal, as well as making small auto tournaments. 

USAGE:
- At least python 3.8+
- Once run, can enter as many names you want in a tournament
- Then hit enter and watch your fighters fight, maybe even bet which of your friends will win
- Items are used if players are at least level 5
